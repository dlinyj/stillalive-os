Notes:
- Might be sometimes glitchy
- ASCII arts draw slow on some system and they pause music
- Does not include staff credits
- Requires PC speaker
- Precompiled image demo.bin requires boot loader, floppy.img is 1.44 MB floppy image (works when flashed on USB too)
- Code is mess
- Runs as x86 real mode opearting system

Please don't use this as x86 operating system template. For template you can see my another project - BruhOS that this project is based on
